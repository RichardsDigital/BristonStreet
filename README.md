Three improvements:

1. Navigation bar (New Cars) drop down menu could be simplified so the following options **In stock**, 
   **Contract hire** and **Our other brands** all list under **Manufacturers** with a drop down menu to filter the options. 
   This way it will look clearer and become easier to navigate.

2. The four navigations options at the top right of the navigation bar should change on hover, 
   this way it will make it clear which option the user will be clicking on.

3. At **‘/used-cars’** the **dealership** option could provide an easier method of search, 
   allowing users to filter their search by selecting a **location** that then reveals 
   the car **manufacturers** in that specific area. I have expanded on this solution with the source code in **this repository**.
